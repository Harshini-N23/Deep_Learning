# Introduction

Deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It empowers computers to learn and make decisions from data, mimicking the human brain's ability to recognize patterns and solve complex problems. Keras, an open-source deep learning framework, provides a user-friendly interface for building and training neural networks.
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in deep learning with Python and Keras. We've curated a list of programs that cover a wide range of topics, from basic neural networks like the Perceptron to advanced techniques such as image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and object detection. 
Whether your goal is to perform binary classification, multiclass classification, regression, or tackle computer vision and natural language processing tasks, our programs will guide you through the process. Each program comes with detailed explanations, code samples, and, where applicable, datasets to help you understand and apply the concepts effectively.
